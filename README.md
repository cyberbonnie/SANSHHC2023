# 2023 SANS Holiday Hack Challenge Write-Up: Six Geese A-Lei'ing

## About

This year, for the first time, I decided to embark on writing a report for the [2023 SANS Holiday Hack Challenge](https://2023.holidayhackchallenge.com/)! Shout out to [Crahan](https://github.com/crahan/HolidayHackChallengeTemplate) for making this awesome and intuitive template available to all.

You can view the report at [https://cyberbonnie.github.io/SANSHHC2023/](https://cyberbonnie.github.io/SANSHHC2023/).
I didn't finish all the challenges during the contest, but I plan to keep updating this report sometime in the future. Any challenges that were completed after the deadline will be clearly marked in the report.
