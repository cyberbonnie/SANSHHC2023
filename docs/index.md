## Introduction

This year, for the first time, I decided to embark on writing a report for the [2023 SANS Holiday Hack Challenge](https://2023.holidayhackchallenge.com/)! Shout out to [Crahan](https://github.com/crahan/HolidayHackChallengeTemplate) for making this awesome and intuitive template available to all.

A trip to the sunny Geese Islands was just the vacation I needed from the cold winter. The itinerary included a cruise around the 6 Geese Islands with shore excursions aplenty. I've created a journal of the challenges I completed that you can check out in the [Objectives](./objectives/o1.md) section. I'm relatively new to the SANS Holiday Hack lore, but I've included some [Easter Eggs](./easter_eggs.md) I've found along the way.

This year included the requirement to a form of AI for at least some of the challenges and Santa gives us a hint with some possibilities.

??? tip "Synthesis is the True Ending"
    *From: Santa*<br/>
    The AI revolution has begun. Some of the most prominent and useful tools born from the advent of powerful AI include ChatGPT, PlayHT, Midjourney, Dall-E 3, Bing AI, and Bard, and Grok.

Throughout this report you will see blocks like the one below that contain my prompts to AI and the responses.

??? example "See AI Assistance"
    **My Prompt:**<br/>
    **ChatGPT Response:**

My Geese Islands itinerary was so jammed packed and I had so much fun I didn't get to see everything, but I'm looking forward to a return trip to catch up on what I've missed and finish this report in the future!

!!! note "100-page submission limit"
    Each year there's a huge number of write-ups that need to be reviewed by the Counter Hack team. To find a good middle ground between preventing information overload and creating a write-up that can stand on its own as a learning resource, some parts, like the *navigation tip* below, are collapsed by default. Skipping over these will not take away from understanding the overall solution, but feel free to expand them to get some additional information.

??? tip "Navigation tip"
    Even with less than 50 pages, there's still quite a bit of information to read through. To make things a little easier, you can use ++"P"++ or ++","++ to go to the previous section, ++"N"++ or ++"."++ to navigate to the next section, and ++"S"++, ++"F"++, or ++"/"++ to open up the search dialog.

    **TL;DR** if you keep pressing ++"N"++ or ++"."++ from this point forward, you'll hit all the content in the right order! :smile:

## Conclusion

!!! Abstract "Narrative (so far)"
    Just sit right back and youâ€™ll hear a tale,<br/>
    A tale of a yuletide trip<br/>
    That started from a tropic port,<br/>
    Aboard this tiny ship<br/>
    Santa and his helpful elves<br/>
    To Geese Islands did go<br/>
    Continuing their merry work<br/>
    O'er sand instead of snow<br/>a
    New this year: a shiny tool<br/>
    The elves logged in with glee<br/>
    What makes short work of many tasks?<br/>
    It's ChatNPT. It's ChatNPT<br/>
    From images to APIs<br/>
    This AI made elves glad<br/>
    But motivations were unknown<br/>
    So was it good or bad?<br/>
    Could it be that NPT<br/>
    Was not from off-the-shelf?<br/>
    Though we'll forgive and trust again<br/>
    We'd found a naughty elf<br/>
    This fancy AI tool of ours<br/>
    With all our work remained<br/>
    Not good or bad, our online friend<br/>
    Just did as it was trained<br/>
    Surely someone's taint must be<br/>
    Upon our AI crutch<br/>
    ...
