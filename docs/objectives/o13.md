    Fitzy Shortstack on Film Noir Island needs help battling dastardly phishers. Help sort the good from the bad!

??? quote "Fitzy Shortstack"
    Just my luck, I thought...<br/>
    A cybersecurity incident right in the middle of this stakeout.<br/>
    Seems we have a flood of unusual emails coming in through ChatNPT.<br/>
    Got a nagging suspicion it isn't catching all the fishy ones.<br/>
    You're our phishing specialist right? Could use your expertise in looking through the output of ChatNPT.<br/>
    Not suggesting a full-blown forensic analysis, just mark the ones screaming digital fraud.<br/>
    We're looking at all this raw data, but sometimes, it takes a keen human eye to separate the chaff, doesn't it?<br/>
    I need to get more powdered sugar for my donuts, so do ping me when you have something concrete on this.<br/>

## Hints

??? tip " DMARC, DKIM, and SPF, oh my!"
    *From: Fitzy Shortstack*<br/>
    *Terminal: Phish Detection*<br/>
    Discover the essentials of email security with DMARC, DKIM, and SPF at [Cloudflare's Guide](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/email-security/dmarc-dkim-spf/).

## Solution
Using our investigative skills and our knowledge of email security that we learned from the [Cloudflare Guide](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/email-security/dmarc-dkim-spf/) in the hint, we need to review the emails in the Inbox and the Phishing tabs and then choose *Mark as Phishing* or *Mark as Safe*.

![phishbegin](../img/objectives/o13/phishingstart.png)

It is important to not only look at the Email Header content, but also the Email Details.
After reviewing the DNS tab, we know that a safe email should have an SPF domain of: `geeseislands.com` and a valid and unaltered DKIM signature. We also want to keep in mind that ChatNPT probably marked some DMARC values incorrectly, so we can't only rely on the DMARC *Pass* or *Fail* values.

![ohishdns](../img/objectives/o13/phishDNS.png)

As we view each email, we see entries like the one below. Even though the DMARC status is *Pass*, the Sender email address is not consistent with the Return-Path in the Email headers. This entry should be marked as *Phishing*.

We continue reviewing all emails until we have correctly categorized all entries. The table below contains the Phishing emails. All other emails in the challenge not listed below are Safe.
