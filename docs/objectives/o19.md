## Objective

!!! question "Request"
    Go to Steampunk Island and help Ribb Bonbowford audit the Azure AD environment. What's the name of the secret file in the inaccessible folder on the FileShare?

??? quote "Ribb Bonbowford"
    Hi there, could you do me a quick favor?<br/>
    Can you go and check on Alabaster Snowball for me? He's at Rainraster Cliffs on Pixel Island. I heard some rumors he's been experimenting with ChatNPT again and I'm a little worried about what he's cooking up.<br/>
    Thank you so much!<br/>
    Please let me know what you find out.<br/><br/>
    Hello, I'm Ribb Bonbowford. Nice to meet you!<br/>
    Oh golly! It looks like Alabaster deployed some vulnerable Azure Function App Code he got from ChatNPT.<br/>
    Don't get me wrong, I'm all for testing new technologies. The problem is that Alabaster didn't review the generated code and used the Geese Islands Azure production environment for his testing.<br/>
    I'm worried because our Active Directory server is hosted there and Wombley Cube's research department uses one of its fileshares to store their sensitive files.<br/>
    I'd love for you to help with auditing our Azure and Active Directory configuration and ensure there's no way to access the research department's data.<br/>
    Since you have access to Alabaster's SSH account that means you're already in the Azure environment. Knowing Alabaster, there might even be some useful tools in place already.<br/>


## Hints

??? tip "Misconfiguration ADventures"
    *From: Alabaster Snowball*<br/>
    *Objective: Active Directory*<br/>
    Certificates are everywhere. Did you know Active Directory (AD) uses certificates as well? Apparently the service used to manage them can have misconfigurations too.

??? tip "Useful Tools"
    *From: Ribb Bonbowford*<br/>
    *Objective: Active Directory*<br/>
    It looks like Alabaster's SSH account has a couple of tools installed which might prove useful.

## Solution

Once we complete [Certificate SSHenanigins](./o15.md), we can work on this challenge. Now that we can log in to the ssh server as `alabaster`, let's see what else we can access. 

```
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/.ssh]
└─$ ssh -i holiday-cert.pub -i ~/.ssh/holiday alabaster@ssh-server-vm.santaworkshopgeeseislands.org
alabaster@ssh-server-vm:~$ ls
alabaster_todo.md  impacket                                                
alabaster@ssh-server-vm:~$    
```
There is impacket installed, which will probably come in handy for this challenge based on the hint from Ribb Bonbowford. In order to not be stuck floundering around the massive Azure REST API options for hours, I asked ChatGPT for some assistance.

??? example "See AI Assistance"
    **My Prompt:** what azure rest api can i use to enumerate all the resources I have access to on an azure VM?<br/>
    **ChatGPT Response:** To enumerate all the resources you have access to on an Azure VM using the Azure REST API, you typically use the Azure Resource Manager (ARM) API. The specific API you would use depends on the type of resources you want to enumerate. Generally, you'd start with the Resource Groups API to list resource groups and then drill down into specific resource types within those groups.<br/>
    Here is a basic outline of the steps using Azure REST APIs:<br/>
    **Get Access Token:** *(snipped this for brevity as we already know how to do this)*<br/>
    **List Resource Groups:** *(snipped this for brevity as we already know how to do this)*<br/>
    **List Resources within a Resource Group:**<br/>
    Once you have the resource group name, you can list the resources within that group using:<br/>
    ```
    GET https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourceGroups/{resource-group-name}/resources?api-version=2021-04-01
    ```
    Replace {subscription-id} with your subscription ID and {resource-group-name} with the actual resource group name.

When we use the API endpoint suggested by ChatGPT, we are able to retrieve the names of two vaults: `northpole-ssh-certs-kv` and `northpole-it-kv`.

```
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer <ACCESSTOKENHERE>" https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/2b0942f3-9bca-484b-a508-abdae2db5e64/resourceGroups/northpole-rg1/resources?api-version=2021-04-01

{"value":[{"id":"/subscriptions/2b0942f3-9bca-484b-a508-abdae2db5e64/resourceGroups/northpole-rg1/providers/Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/northpole-ssh-certs-kv","name":"northpole-ssh-certs-kv","type":"Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults","location":"eastus","tags":{}},{"id":"/subscriptions/2b0942f3-9bca-484b-a508-abdae2db5e64/resourceGroups/northpole-rg1/providers/Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/northpole-it-kv","name":"northpole-it-kv","type":"Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults","location":"eastus","tags":{}}]}
```
Let's look for [more information](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/keyvault/keyvault/vaults/list-by-resource-group?view=rest-keyvault-keyvault-2022-07-01&tabs=HTTP) about these vaults.

```

```
We can see the vault URIs `https://northpole-it-kv.vault.azure.net/` and `https://northpole-ssh-certs-kv.vault.azure.net/`. I also saw some permissions information for the `northpole-ssh-certs-kv` vault like `permissions":{"keys":["all"],"secrets":["all"],"certificates":["all"],"storage":["all"]}}`. This sounded promising so I focused on this vault first (hint: never assume one *must* correct without checking other options). 

AFter some trial and error with diffrent Keys and Secrets API enpoints, I determined the [Get Secrets API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/keyvault/secrets/get-secrets/get-secrets?view=rest-keyvault-secrets-7.4&tabs=HTTP) has what we need. This requires a different access token that the type we have been using for `management.azure.com`. We now need one for `vault.azure.net`, so let's get that first.

```
curl 'http://169.254.169.254/metadata/identity/oauth2/token?api-version=2018-02-01&resource=https%3A%2F%2Fvault.azure.net' -H Metadata:true -s
{"access_token":"<ACCESSTOKENHERE>","client_id":"b84e06d3-aba1-4bcc-9626-2e0d76cba2ce","expires_in":"85627","expires_on":"1703195568","ext_expires_in":"86399","not_before":"1703108868","resource":"https://vault.azure.net","token_type":"Bearer"}
```
Then we use this access token to get the secrets on the vault.

```
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer <ACCESSTOKENHERE>" https://northpole-it-kv.vault.azure.net/secrets?api-version=7.4

{"value":[{"id":"https://northpole-it-kv.vault.azure.net/secrets/tmpAddUserScript","attributes":{"enabled":true,"created":1699564823,"updated":1699564823,"recoveryLevel":"Recoverable+Purgeable","recoverableDays":90},"tags":{}}],"nextLink":null}
```
We have a script name `tmpAddUserScript`, let's get more information on that secret.

```
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer <ACCESSTOKENHERE>" https://northpole-it-kv.vault.azure.net/secrets/tmpAddUserScript/?api-version=7.4

{"value":"Import-Module ActiveDirectory; $UserName = \"elfy\"; $UserDomain = \"northpole.local\"; $UserUPN = \"$UserName@$UserDomain\"; $Password = ConvertTo-SecureString \"J4`ufC49/J4766\" -AsPlainText -Force; $DCIP = \"10.0.0.53\"; New-ADUser -UserPrincipalName $UserUPN -Name $UserName -GivenName $UserName -Surname \"\" -Enabled $true -AccountPassword $Password -Server $DCIP -PassThru","id":"https://northpole-it-kv.vault.azure.net/secrets/tmpAddUserScript/ec4db66008024699b19df44f5272248d","attributes":{"enabled":true,"created":1699564823,"updated":1699564823,"recoveryLevel":"Recoverable+Purgeable","recoverableDays":90},"tags":{}}
```
We have made a break through! We now have the Domain Controller (DC) name, IP, and a username, and password. Let's see if we can get access to the DC.<br/>
I read a bit about domain escalation techniques<br/>

and reviewed some information from a [previous challenge](./o4.md).

Using Certipy we find a vulnerable certificate template:

I next tried to generate a certificate via certipy using the NorthPoleUsers template, but I kept getting a user not found error `[-] Got error while trying to request TGT: Kerberos SessionError: KDC_ERR_C_PRINCIPAL_UNKNOWN(Client not found in Kerberos database)`. <br/>
Using the `GetADUsers` impacket tool, we can get the list of Active Directory users.

We're able to access the *Fileshare* and find the file in `super_secret_research` to get our answer. We also have a treasure trove of cookie recipes!

??? tip "Cookie Recipes"
    To save the cookie recipes locally on my machine, I base 64 encoded the files. Then copied the base64 from the TTY, saved it to my local host and then decoded the files. Yum!

```
alabaster@ssh-server-vm:~/impacket$ cat todo.txt 
1. Bake some cookies.
2. Restrict access to C:\FileShare\super_secret_research to only researchers so everyone cant see the folder or read its contents
3. Profit

alabaster@ssh-server-vm:~/impacket$ cat InstructionsForEnteringSatelliteGroundStation.txt 
Note to self:

To enter the Satellite Ground Station (SGS), say the following into the speaker:

And he whispered, 'Now I shall be out of sight;
So through the valley and over the height.'
And he'll silently take his way.

## Response

!!! quote "Ribb Bonbowford"
    Wow, nice work. I'm impressed!<br/>
    This is all starting to feel like more than just a coincidence though. Everything Alabaster's been setting up lately with the help of ChatNPT contains all these vulnerabilities. It almost feels deliberate, if you ask me.<br/>
    Now obviously an LLM AI like ChatNPT cannot have deliberate motivations itself. It's just a machine. But I wonder who could have built it and who is controlling it?<br/>
    On top of that, we apparently have a satellite ground station on Geese Islands. I wonder where that thing would even be located.<br/>
    Well, I guess it's probably somewhere on Space Island, but I've not been there yet.<br/>
    I'm not a big fan of jungles, you see. I have this tendency to get lost in them.<br/>
    Anyway, if you feel like investigating, that'd be where I'd go look.<br/>
    Good luck and I'd try and steer clear of ChatNPT if I were you.<br/>
